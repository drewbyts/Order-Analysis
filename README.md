# Customer Order Analysis ðŸ“’

# Goal 
The goal was to compute summary statistics, conduct a cohort analysis, and extract the LTV of customers from an order dataset.

# Method
I ingested, cleaned, and transformed an order dataset in Python. I utilized Seaborn, Pandas, and Matplotlib to analyze and visualize findings.

# Results 
For the period 01-23-21 to 03-21-21, I discovered that there were 1512 unique customers with an average order of $2,675.00. I found that sales were aggressive on the weekend, averaging 1.16M.

Additionally,  I identified that 20.6% of the customers who placed an order, ordered more than once. But, on average , 88% of customers don't make a second purchase in the subsequent weekâ€”â€” high churn and low retention exists. Lastly, I found the churn rate of customers to be 79.4%. People place orders but a majority don't. What is causing this? Is this dataset about a service like DoorDash or Uber where customers have x amount of free orders? More information is needed.
