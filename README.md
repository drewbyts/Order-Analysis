# Customer Order Analysis ðŸ“’

# Goal 
The goal was to compute summary statistics, conduct a cohort analysis, and extract the LTV of customers from an order dataset.

# Method
I ingested, cleaned, and transformed an order dataset in Python. I utilized Seaborn, Pandas, and Matplotlib to analyze and visualize findings.

# Results 
For the period 01-23-21 to 03-21-21, I discovered that there were 1512 unique customers with an average order of $2,675.00. I found that sales were aggressive on the weekend, averaging 1.16M.


This Jupyter Notebook project involved data wrangling, data transformation, and data visualization. The output includes a Cohort, Churn/Retention, and Customer Lifetime Value Analysis!  ðŸ˜ƒ
